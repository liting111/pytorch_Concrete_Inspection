CCNY Concrete Structure Spalling and Crack database (CSSC) that aims to assist the civil inspection of performing in an automatical approach. In the first generate of our work, we mainly focusing on dataset creation and prove the concepts of innovativity. We provide the first complete the detailed dataset for concrete spalling and crack defects witht the help from Civil Engineers, where we also show our sincere thanks to the under-graduate student at Hostos Community College for their effort on data labeling. For our experiments, we deliever an UAV to perform field data-collection and inspection, and also perform a 3D semantic metric resconstructiont.

# How to implement
## training
1) First download the data from: https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/concreteIn_inpection_VGGF/

2) Put the data in folder SPallData

3) run script:
> - python main.py

## test
1) Change the model directory of the model

2) run script:
> - python demo_test.py


## How to change model

In file model.py, you can change any model you prefer:

>- #from models import resnet as resnet
>-from models import resnet as resnet
>-#from models import vgg as resnet
>-#from models.alexnet import *
>-def generate_model(opt):
>-    model = resnet.resnet34(pretrained = True, num_classes=opt.n_classes)

## define epoch, batch size, output folder

Please check file opts.py
